# Vector
- it's a function that maps something to a value
	* [1,3,4] it maps 0 index to 1, 1 index to 3 ...

Notes:
	The traditional, abstract approach to linear algebra does not directly define vectors at all.
	Just as a field is defined as a set of values with some operations (+, -, *, /) that satisfy
	certain algebraic laws, a vector space is defined as a set with some operations that satisfy
	certain algebraic laws; then vectors are the things in that set. This approach is more
	general but it is more abstract, hence harder for some people to grasp. If you continue in
	mathematics, you will become very familiar with the abstract approach.

	- It's a class of objects (set) that satisfy certain algebraic rules
